1. In order to perform repetitive tasks, we use loops
=> Ashish [10 times]

//1. while

while(condition)
{
  //this will execute only if condition is true
  // and if the condition fails, loop stops
  I/D operator
}

//2. for loop

for(initializeVariable; Condition; I/D)
{
  //this will execute only if condition is true
  // and if the condition fails, loop stops
}

//3. Advanced for loop

for(dataTypeOfGroup aliasName : nameOfGroup)
{
action
}
//4. Advantages of one loop over the other
